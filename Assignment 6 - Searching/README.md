# Assignment 6 - Searching

## This week we learned about...
- Linear Search
- Binary Search 
- Interpolation Search 

### Linear Search
- Linear search sequentially checks each element of a data set. It is generally not as efficient as other options unless the data set is very small.

### Binary Search
- Binary search requires a sorted data set. It compares the value in the middle of the data set to the value being searched for. If the values are equal, the target has been found. If the values are not equal, the algorithm determines which half of the data set will contain the target (is the target less than or greater than the element in the middle of the sorted array?). The search procedure is repeated recursively with the remaining half of the data set that will contain the target value.

### Interpolation Search
- Requires a sorted data set. Binary search always chooses the middle of the data set before discarding one half or the other. Interpolation search uses keys. For interpolation search to work efficiently data must be uniformly distributed (in addition to being sorted).

## What does this program do?
the program that I created for this assignment searches for terms within a data set using various searching algorithims.
