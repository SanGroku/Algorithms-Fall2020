# Algorithms-Fall2020
*A collection of code created in Algorithms class*

## Week 1
* **Definitions:**
  * *Pseudocode:* A way to check if the structure and details needed to implement an algorithm into code make sense before actually implementing them. 
  * *Specificaiton:* A formal statement of what a software is meant to accomplish. The intention behind the software. 
  * *Precondition:* A statement of assumptions we make about the input to the algorithm and the enviornment in which it will be executed. 
  * *Postcondition:* A statement of the required result of the executing algorithm, assuming the precondition is satisfied. 
  * *Reduction:* Solving a problem by reducing it to one or more simpler problems. 
  * *Recursion:* The process in which a function directly or indirectly calls on itself. 
  * *Loop:* A series of instruction that continually repeats. 
  * *Transformaiton:* When a reduction had the form that the solution to the simpler problem solves the original problem. 
  * *Asymptotic Notation:* The mathematical notations used to describe the run time of an alogrithm. 
  * *Tail Recursion:* When a larger instance is transformed to a smaller instance of the same problem. The last step of the solution is arecursive call. 
  
* **Aymptotic Notation Symbols and their Usage**
  * Θ: To express identical uper and lower bounds. 
  * O: To express upper bounds
  * Ω: To express lower bounds. 
  
* **big-O Notation:**
  * O(1): Describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set. *Constant.* 
  * O(n): Describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. *Linear.*
  * O(n^2): An algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data. *Quadratic.* 
  * O(2^n): An algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set. *Exponential.*
