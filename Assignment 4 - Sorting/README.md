# Assignment 4  - Sorting
**Sorting Algorithms** - Sorting algortithms are a great way to organize data sets using code. 

## This week we learned about...
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Heap Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort

### Bubble Sort
- The bubble sort algorithm begins at the beginning of an array and swaps the first two elements if the first happens to be greater than the second. This continues for each pair in the data set. 

### Insertion Sort
- The insertion sort algorithm is a simple algorithm taht builds the final sorted set one item at a time. This works well with smaller sata sets, but not very well on larger sets. 

### Selection Sort
- The selection algorithm is an in-place comparison type of algorithm. This is not efficient for large lists, and performs worse than the insertion sort algorithm. 

### Heap Sort
- The heapsort algorithm is a comparison-based sort-in-place algorithm that takes no extra storage. it is often refered to as an improved selection. The runtime for this algorithm is O(n log n) which is the fastest possible for an algorithm that sorts using comparisons. 

### Quick Sort
- The quicksort algorithm is a comparison-based sort-in-place divide-and-conquer strategy. What this means is that the larger group is seperated into smaller groups that can be processed or handled easily. 

### Merge sort
- LikequickSort, merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.

## What does this application do?
The program that I created for this assignment uses the various methods of sorting to sort a set of data stored in a txt file.
