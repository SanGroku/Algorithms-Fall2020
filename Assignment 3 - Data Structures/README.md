# Assignment 3 - Data Structures
**Data Structures** - A data structure is a specific wat of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used in the most efficient way possible. 

## This week we learned about..
- Arrays
- Maps (dictionaries, hash tables)
- Stacks 
- Queues

### Array vs Maps
- An **Array** is a collection of elements of the same data type. This elements are indexed starting from 0 and going up. Arrays can be one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or even multi-dimensional. 

- A **Map** stores elements in a mapped fashion. Each element had a key value and a mapped value. No two mapped values can have the same key value. What's good about this is that each key will be unique.  

### Stacks vs Queue
- the **Stack** Takes elements in LIFO style. This means that the last element in is the first element out. This is useful for storing temporary data because elements can be delete after retrieving their value. 

- The **Queue** is the opposite of the stack. Elements are stored in a FIFO style. This means that the first element in will be the first element out. 

## What does this program do??
The program I created for this assignment takes a txt file and stores it in the various data structures.
